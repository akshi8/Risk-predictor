## Inspiration 💡

This app has been developed in order to predict the risk of individuals being drawn into online sex work. We want this app to be a reference for adult website users and educators in this field to gauge the effect of their activity on such sites and to avoid any harm to themselves.❤️ 

## What it does 

It predicts the risk of an innocent individual falling prey to the web of online sex-work by using their preferences and their online activity as features to understand their susceptibility to it. The data used to build this app can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/panoskostakos/online-sex-work). This database was used in the paper: “Covert online ethnography and machine learning for detecting individuals at risk of being drawn into online sex work”

## How we built it 👩
💻

Using R and Shiny apps.

## Challenges we ran into 🚵
♀️

- Inadequate data
- anonymized data-fields
- Some App functionality
- Lower Score of prediction algorithm based on training data

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😍

Building and deploying a working machine learning model within 10 hours of the inception of its idea! And, getting 72% accuracy on our classification model on our first try.

## What we learned 🧐

We learned based on the online-activity and individual characteristics there can be a high risk of teens and young adults falling prey to online sex work or the sex trade.

## What's next for Online Sex-work Risk Prediction 🔍

With the availability of more data and data-sources, the online-sex-work-predictor will have more robust predictions 
Also, We will be using a web-API to extract data for predicting some individual is at Risk
